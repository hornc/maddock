The cavalcade listen and are eventually impressed.
The **coin machine servicer**, when no one is looking, takes the maggot (Rhagoletis pomonella) writhing spasmodically outside the soft flesh of its preferred substrate from the mantel and pockets it.


The public room is next to empty.
The youthful-cum-ardent **librarian**, E______ begins talking about a past relationship with a Duchess of Świnoujście

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no idea what that is." responds a bystander.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Barkeep! What's in this food? It tastes like purl!" someone whispers loudly. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'd rather consume overboard seawater than listen to that!" quips a bystander.
Presently the bar-staffer sprints over to take the cavalcade's orders. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cook's dead, you'll just have to order drinks. What'll it be?"


 The group look dissapointed, but order their drinks.

Next in procession moves the threatened and passionate **multimedia artist**, who is preocupied with a twist of red string. Next in file proceeds the youthful-cum-ardent **librarian**, who happily brandishes a bag containing cheapest snuff. Then passes the loving but shy **dentist**, who deceivingly brandishes a reliquary housing fragments of the left ulnar of Saint Ioannis of Durham, reservedly followed by the lovable and impressive **desktop publisher**, followed by the receptive but not so talkative and cautious **cleaner**, who is preocupied with a hair pin.

 By the counter hangs a painting of a coastal scene.
 Upon the mantel in the main room, above a roaring fire, are the following items: one small coin.

Above the mantle hangs a vicious looking falchion. Next to it is a small label. The inscription upon it is unfortunately obscured by what looks like stains of piss.

The public room has a reasonable crowd.
A patron broadly spills a parted drink beside the stairs.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Barkeep! What's in this food? It tastes like rubbing alcohol!" someone whispers loudly. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no idea what that is." responds the lounge-operative.
A patron storms off .
A small fight breaks out over by the door.
One of the travellers storms off and slithers vastly away past the alcove towards the coat rack.
A patron promptly spills a vanilla drink on top of the landing.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But... that's not how I remember it..." snarls the trembly surly **transportation worker**, A_______.

Off in the distance, a fly makes its presence felt .

The travellers approach the innkeeper well, who is busy with something over by the nook. 
The innkeeper, E____ of L_____, has a sympathetic personality, and some aerosol prolific moralising to impart. Then suddenly, without a word, the innkeeper impatiently waves the troupe to a table, situated near the balustrade.

The weary travellers sit at the unparalleled table.

The lovable and impressive **desktop publisher**, W_______ bears witness to the following indiscriminate interaction bewtween two other of the group:
The blissful nonetheless candid **segmental paver**, L________, and the receptive but not so talkative and cautious **cleaner**, J_______, set down to the business of trading. The **segmental paver** swaps a metal mirror for the **cleaner**'s hair pin.


A surly drunk standing partially obscuring a surly drunk creates a puddle of slowly spreading and acidentally spilled piss on top of the coat rack.
Presently the scullery-hand catapults over to take the travellers's orders. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I interest you in some victuals?".

 The group order food. a patron storms off and scoots wetly away past the architecturally interesting fireplace towards the window. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pees! We are trying to order food!" snarls the threatened and passionate **multimedia artist**, Q_______, often.
The lovable and impressive **desktop publisher**, W_______, starts talking about their interest in animal husbandry. One of the troupe nods in agreement.

The group feels sullen as they approach the entrance to the inn.

The trembly surly **transportation worker**, A_______, leads the troupe and enters the inn first, stooping low to enter via the glass paned door. The **transportation worker** stops briefly to admire their moth-eaten dress in a mirror placed in the entranceway.

The troupe listen and are greedily impressed.
The **sales representative**, when no one is looking, takes the small coin from the mantel and pockets it.


The public room is next to empty.
A dormouse, sitting under a table next to the stairs, gives itself a hot-button scratch as if it were waved.
A small fight breaks out over by the door.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Barkeep! What's in this food? It tastes like fermenting fruit pulp!" someone jokes loudly. A patron nods in agreement. A patron merrily spills a wanton drink on top of the window.
The attendant wait-server is called away and bounds deeply away past the storeroom towards the fireplace.
A patron upbeat spills a willful drink sprawling out towards the coat rack, by a crate labelled "Luboń
's unparalleled jimsonweed", sprawling out towards the door, by a crate labelled "Leszno
's incomparably excellent tobacco", sprawling out towards the corner, by some boxes a crate labelled "Racibórz
's meanest turnip" a crate labelled "Poręba
's cheapest grape" the counter.
A patron helpfully spills a unimaginative drink sprawling out towards the balustrade, by some boxes, next to some boxes, partially obscuring some boxes the counter.
The bar-staffer calls for last drink orders.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Barkeep! What's in this food? It tastes like juice!" someone snarls loudly. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'd rather consume deluded rose-water than think about that nonsense!" laughs a bystander standing on top of the attendant wait-server.
Seemingly emanating from an upstairs room, a horse makes its presence felt as if it were solid-state.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But... that's not how I remember it..." quips the faithful and inexperienced **fisher**, B____. The **transportation worker** (who is the current storyteller) glares witheringly at the **fisher**, indignant at the low-budget inerruption, then resumes the tale..
Nearby a crow makes its presence felt as if it were convertible.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aleyn! We are but fourteen weary travellers in need of lodging and good cheer!" quips the dreary and churlish **dinkey operator**, G_______. 
The innkeeper, Q_______, has a critical visage, and some muted entangled news to impart. Then suddenly, without a word, the innkeeper impatiently waves the cavalcade to a table, situated near the fireplace next to some boxes.

The weary travellers sit at the risque table.
The party remark upon a patron's manner.
The petrified nonetheless desolate and arguably modest **occupational therapy aide**, W________, starts talking about their interest in the creative output of Elizabeth Báthory. .

 The party look dissapointed, but order their drinks.


One of the cavalcade is excused innocently and moves dreamily away past the main room next to some boxes towards the bar.

The dreary and churlish **dinkey operator**, G_______, leads the wanderers and enters the inn first, impatiently beckoning the company to follow through the doorway. The **dinkey operator** stops briefly to admire their tattered suit in a mirror placed in the entranceway.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This falchion used to belong to my sister's confessor's servant who got it from their father who got it from their father who got it from their captain who is commonly known, in western parts at least, as Chekhov."

The party listen and are valiantly impressed.
The **dinkey operator** wanders over to take a look, and adds a twist of yellow wool to the collection of trinkets.


The public room is moderately crowded.

One of the cavalcade by the fireplace storms off and moves soon away past the corner towards the main room.
The pastry-cook is called away and speeds kookily away past the fireplace towards the door which looks as if it were designed in a collaboration between Jackson Pollock and Hieronymus Bosch at a luckless revolutionary action hosted by Martha Stewart while high on blood mixed with a tiny amount of rubbing alcohol next to some boxes.

's unparalleled lint".

The weary travellers sit at the onward table.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not how it happened at all!" interrupts the stunned-cum-brave **sales representative**, J_____. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas!" whispers the faithful and inexperienced **fisher**, B____, "Let the **forestry teacher** finish the tale!".
The trembly surly **transportation worker**, A_______, and the threatened and passionate **multimedia artist**, Q_______, set down to the business of trading. The **transportation worker** swaps a jeweled mirror for the **multimedia artist**'s reliquary housing fragments of the left ulnar of Saint Ioannis of Durham.
The needy and ashamed-cum-well-behaved **valve installer**, N____, listens in and does not understand.


A owl, sitting under a table next to the fireplace which looks as if it were designed by Martha Stewart at a plausible baccanalia hosted by Zaha Hadid under the influence of jimson-weed and pastry crumbs and ash, gives itself a fated scratch as if it were veritable.
Presently the inkeeper bounds over to take the group's orders. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is our menu, you won't find better fare within three score and six leagues of these walls!".

The youthful-cum-ardent **librarian**, E______, begins to sing:

> I leant my back unto an aik,  
O stay, my ain dear marrow!  
The first man was Allen-a-Dale,  
Ane mantle of the burning gowd  
And wae betide the bush of brier!  
"The water runnes swift, and wondrous deepe,  
There did he espy the same young man  
I dreamt me of tow wighty yemen,  
"This is thy true love," Robin he said,  
Erle Douglas on his milke-white steede,  
For whatever is dealt at her funeral to-day,  
Come riding to the town.

The sign sparkles in the sun.
The group feels unneeded as they approach the entrance to the inn.

The dreary and churlish **dinkey operator**, G_______, leads the company and enters the inn first, stooping low to enter via the doorway. There are Arthurian sounds emanating from the kitchen. The **dinkey operator** laughs 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'd like some of that!".

The innkeeper, Z______ the K_______, has a phony bearing, and some gibberish rumours to impart. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grab yourselves a table, I'll send someone over to take your orders..."

The weary travellers sit at the interdependent table.
A bystander by the alcove which looks as if it were designed by Jackson Pollock at a remorseless guided meditation hosted by Salvador Dali while high on seawater and vomit storms off and slinks knavishly away past the architecturally interesting coat rack which looks as if it were designed by Hieronymus Bosch  while high on rubbing alcohol mixed with a tiny amount of purl towards the kitchen.

Not the industrious yet steady **forestry teacher**, V______ again!" quips the faithful and inexperienced **fisher**, B____, "Let's hear the trembly surly **transportation worker**, A_______, instead!" After some glorified discussion and bickering, the party agree wrongly to hear the trembly surly **transportation worker**, A_______, over the industrious yet steady **forestry teacher**, V______.

> Ere day-light did appeare;  
In prison fast let her lie:  
The ankers brak, and the topmasts lap,  
When I turned about, away to gae?  
Rather than ye should thus for me  
At last she spake with trembling voyce,  
I love but you alone.  
Nae living man I'll love again,  
And throughout all the world did flye  
Robin thought on Our Ladye deere,  
And said, "What's that to thee?  
And I myself were dead and gane!  
For the trespass thou hast me done,  
And throwing strait their bows away,

Four lusty travellers make their way by camel towards *The L________'s L________* Inn.
The weather is very fair.

At the forefront of the party approaches the youthful-cum-ardent **librarian**, who is wearing a blue suit made of expensive leather. Doggedly after goes, subsequently, stoically, the industrious yet steady **forestry teacher**, who is wearing a elegant robe, followed by the loving but shy **dentist**, who is preocupied with a battered snuff-box tightly packed with astounding laudanum.


The loving but shy **dentist**, G_______ witnesses a backstage interaction, and does not understand.
The youthful-cum-ardent **librarian**, E______ , interacts with the loving but shy **dentist**, G_______ .
It is a neutral interaction.

 By the storeroom hangs a painting of a coastal scene.
 There is a roaring fire in the public room. Its mantel is bare.

Above the mantle hangs a vicious looking falchion. Next to it is a small baked clay tablet. The inscription upon it is unfortunately obscured by what looks like stains of aqua regia.
The **forestry teacher** wanders over to take a look, and adds a purple glass bead to the collection of trinkets.


The public room is packed with very rowdy patrons.
A surly drunk by the shelf standing sprawling out towards the door, by some boxes beside an amphora of ale a surly drunk by the landing mops up a puddle of  gin precariously balanced upon the counter.
The loving but shy **dentist**, G_______ begins talking about a past relationship with a merchant of Chodzież

The lounge-operative calls for a shoulder to cry on.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Barkeep! What's in this food? It tastes like gin!" someone jokes loudly. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'd rather consume timid mercury than think about that nonsense!" laughs one of the party.
A rat, sitting under a table next to the portico, gives itself a fainter scratch as if it were reminiscent.
A fly, sitting under a table next to the balustrade, gives itself a fraudulent scratch as if it were willing.
The bar-staffer is called away .
Nearby a moth makes its presence felt .



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Out! We are but four weary travellers in need of lodging and good cheer!" quips the youthful-cum-ardent **librarian**, E______.

The loving but shy **dentist**, G_______, compliments the youthful-cum-ardent **librarian**, E______'s blue suit made of expensive leather. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your blue suit made of expensive leather is so much more chivalrous than my meager voluminous hauberk!" quips the **dentist**.




The grounds-keeper enters from outside bearing a astounding some boxes and places it on top of an amphora of slops, next to the nook.
Presently the inkeeper slinks over to take the party's orders. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We're all out of food, sorry, you'll just have to order drinks. What'll it be?"


 The travellers look dissapointed, but order their drinks.


A bystander standing partially obscuring a patron is excused promptly .

 ## 22: The **Librarian**'s Fourth Tale (4)

A trio of weary travellers make their way by barge towards *The E____'s V____* Inn.
The weather is very blustery.

At the forefront of the party comes the youthful-cum-ardent **librarian**, who is wearing a blue suit made of expensive leather. Next in this glare the group processes the industrious yet steady **forestry teacher**, who is wearing a elegant robe.



As they near their destination they notice  the Inn's sign depicts a very diseased v____, belonging to a tailed e____. Stylistically, the sign looks as if it were designed by Elizabeth Báthory at a prewar revolutionary action hosted by Julia Child while high on rubbing alcohol and rubbing alcohol. The sign clatters in the wind.
The group feels satiric as they approach the entrance to the inn.

The youthful-cum-ardent **librarian**, E______, leads the wanderers and enters the inn first, impatiently beckoning the troupe to follow through the ramshackle door. The **librarian** stops briefly to admire their blue suit made of expensive leather in a mirror placed in the entranceway.
The innkeeper nods in agreement


The interior of The E____'s V____ compells them forward with its welcoming chasteness. Over by the coat rack lies an amphora of stew beside an amphora of purl.
 By the stairs hangs a painting of a coastal scene.
 Upon the mantel in the main room, above a roaring fire, are the following items: one purple glass bead.

Above the mantle hangs a vicious looking falchion. Next to it is a small luggage tag. The inscription upon it is unfortunately obscured by what looks like stains of formic acid.
The **forestry teacher**, when no one is looking, takes the purple glass bead from the mantel and pockets it.


The public room is next to empty.
The lounge-operative storms off .
The bar-staffer calls for a shoulder to cry on.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not how it happened at all!" interrupts the industrious yet steady **forestry teacher**, V______. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lo!" jokes the ((C2)), "Let the **librarian** finish the tale!".
The innkeeper by the architecturally interesting fireplace standing next to the innkeeper standing partially obscuring the bar-staffer standing beside one of the party by the stairs by the coat rack standing beside a bystander by the architecturally interesting balustrade gingerly steps over a puddle of stale blood on top of the alcove.
The bar-staffer calls for their mother.
The grounds-keeper is called away and bounds past the rocking chair.
The attendant wait-server enters from outside bearing a  an amphora of blood and places it next to an amphora of rubbing alcohol sprawling out towards the balustrade, by some boxes some boxes, next to the balustrade which looks as if it were designed in a collaboration between Tracy Emin and Martha Stewart at a blooded high tea hosted by Jackson Pollock while high on ash.
A patron obediently spills a heart drink beside the counter.
The assistant-manager calls for silence.
Nearby a thrush makes a traditional sound as if it were slamming.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha! Look over there by the portico; there is the innkeeper, looking rather delighted. Let us talk to him!" quips the industrious yet steady **forestry teacher**, V______. 
The innkeeper, F_____ the C_____, has a delighted bearing, and some oversize complaints to impart. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be seated, I'll be with you shortly to take orders..."

The weary travellers sit at the strengthened table.
The vinter is called away and walks past the rug.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Barkeep! What's in this food? It tastes like gin!" someone jokes loudly. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'd rather consume fainter aqua regia than listen to that!" whispers a patron standing precariously balanced upon a surly drunk by the kitchen standing partially obscuring a surly drunk.
Presently the pot-scrubber saunters over to take the cavalcade's orders. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is our menu, you won't find better fare within five score leagues of these walls!".

 The travellers order food. The youthful-cum-ardent **librarian**, E______, places orders for all the company.
A small fight breaks out over by the fireplace.


In order to entertain themselves, because the night is young, the travellers decide to pass the time telling stories, and chose from their number one person to tell this evening's tale...
The **forestry teacher** stands up to be the next storyteller.

The industrious yet steady **forestry teacher**, V______, waits for the chatter to subside and begins his tale...

 ## 23: The **Forestry Teacher**'s Eighth Tale (8)

A pair of intrepid travellers make their way by coach towards *The T_____'s B____* Inn.
The weather is rainy.

At the forefront of the party travels the industrious yet steady **forestry teacher**, who sucks strictly on a purple glass bead.



As they near their destination they notice  the Inn's sign depicts a very inbound b____, belonging to a perpetuate t_____. Stylistically, the sign looks as if it were designed by Elizabeth Báthory  under the influence of formic acid and tobacco. The sign is drenched in the downpour.
The group feels crazy as they approach the entrance to the inn.

The industrious yet steady **forestry teacher**, V______, leads the party and enters the inn first, impatiently beckoning the troupe to follow through the sturdy door. The **forestry teacher** stops briefly to admire their elegant robe in a mirror placed in the entranceway.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'd rather consume amino seawater than listen to that!" whispers the assistant-manager


The interior of The T_____'s B____ repells them with its warmth. Over by the shelf lies a crate labelled "Czarnków
's unparalleled pastry crumbs".
 By the architecturally interesting coat rack hangs a painting of a coastal scene.
 There is a roaring fire in the public room. Its mantel is bare.

Above the mantle hangs a vicious looking falchion. Next to it is a small plaque. It reads: "falchion of Chekhov ".
The **forestry teacher** wanders over to take a look, and adds a purple glass bead to the collection of trinkets.


The public room is almost empty.
Seemingly emanating from an upstairs room, a mule makes a precocious sound .



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Iesus! We are but a pair of weary travellers in need of lodging and good cheer!" jokes the industrious yet steady **forestry teacher**, V______. 
The innkeeper, W________ the O________, has a wary manner, and some combined complaints to impart. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grab yourselves a table, I'll be with you shortly to take orders..."

The weary travellers sit at the peacekeeping table.
Presently the stable-hand slinks over to take the troupe's orders. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, what do you lot want?".

 Presently the travellers place their orders. The industrious yet steady **forestry teacher**, V______, places orders for all the company.


In order to entertain themselves, as tradition dictates, the company decide to pass the time telling stories, and chose from their number one person to tell this evening's tale...

You listen in silence to the **forestry teacher**'s tale. You can't help eyeing the falchion above the mantel, dark thoughts running through your mind.

Tomorrow there will be one less traveller on the journey ahead.

**ÞE END**
