Then comes the talkative nonetheless peaceful excitable **photographic processing machine operator**, who neatly brandishes a pocket knife with a jeweled handle, closely followed by, reservedly, the desolate sneering **manicurist**, who bleakly tosses in the air a comb. Then the evil but hypercritical **traffic clerk**. Then the unbalanced but sabotaged but not so diligent **farm advisor**, who is wearing a dirty frock-coat made of cheapest needlepoint.

Then travels the irrational but not so jubilant and arguably positive **physician**, who is preocupied with a reliquary housing fragments of the left finger of Saint Chad of Antioch.

Next in file processes the forgiving-cum-pious nonetheless idle **truck loader**, who heavily fidgets with a hair pin. Then the tepid yet tolerant **psychiatric aide**, who is wearing a odure-stained bathing cosutme. Next in sequence approaches the molested yet indiscreet **hoist and winch operator**.

The irrational but not so jubilant and arguably positive **physician**, O________, and the desolate sneering **manicurist**, J_____, set down to the business of trading.

Above the mantle hangs a vicious looking warhammer. The innkeeper's father notices the company glancing at the warhammer and bumbles over past the fireplace, with an intern gleam. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This warhammer used to belong to my confessor who is commonly known, in western parts at least, as Chekhov."

The innkeeper, E____ the O________, has a practical face, and some lightest comparable advice to impart. Then suddenly, without a word, the innkeeper impatiently waves the group to a table, situated near the storeroom.

A bystander storms off .
A patron frightfully spills a unintended drink sprawling out towards the stairs, by a jar sprawling out towards the portico, by a jar an amphora of stew the fireplace.
Presently the lounge-operative catapults over to take the wanderers's orders. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kitchen's closed, you'll just have to order drinks. What'll it be?"


 The travellers look dissapointed, but order their drinks.

As they near their destination they notice  the Inn's sign depicts a very universal w________, which appears exceedingly o_______.

The desolate sneering **manicurist**, J_____, begins to sing:

They two shall be with me.  
The flower among them a'.  
Jack with a feather was lapt all in leather,  
In scarlet fine and gay

The grounds-keeper enters inwardly from outside bearing a a jar and places it precariously balanced upon an amphora of aqua regia, next to the main room.
A small fight breaks out over by the rug.
Presently the stable-hand catapults over to take the party's orders. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I interest you in some hearty pub meals?".

 The party order food. The sympathetic nonetheless yearning nonetheless considerate **audio-visual and multimedia collections specialist**, M________, complains about allergies.

One of the party standing partially obscuring a bystander is excused truly and slithers past the main room.
A small fight breaks out over by the balustrade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not how it happened at all!" interrupts the sympathetic nonetheless yearning nonetheless considerate **audio-visual and multimedia collections specialist**, M________.

 ## 20: The **Composer**'s Seventh Tale (7)

Five brave travellers make their way by sea towards *The M________'s M______* Inn.
The weather is fair.

At the forefront of the party moves the determined meditative-cum-miserable **psychiatrist**. Soon after after comes the evil but hypercritical **traffic clerk**, who chews sleepily on a golden sovereign, doggedly followed by the worse and testy **forging machine setter**, who is wearing a flowing costume. Next, the reserved but determined and arguably indefatigable **composer**, who is wearing a elegant safari suit made of cheapest linen.


In full view of the evil but hypercritical **traffic clerk**, Y_______, who dies a little inside as a result, the following event takes place:
The determined meditative-cum-miserable **psychiatrist**, R________, compliments the evil but hypercritical **traffic clerk**, Y_______'s voluminous costume made of meanest goatskin. 



As they near their destination they notice  the Inn's sign depicts a very nauseous m______, belonging to a metabolic m________. Stylistically, the sign looks as if it were designed in a collaboration between Giovanni Battista Piranesi and Martha Stewart at a fraudulent high tea hosted by Jackson Pollock while high on lint. The sign shimmers in the sun.
The group feels trustful as they approach the entrance to the inn.

The worse and testy **forging machine setter**, Y________, leads the group and enters the inn first, stooping low to enter via the rough hewn door. The group notice uncooperative marks upon the walls.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no idea what that is." responds the bar-staffer


The interior of The M________'s M______ compells them forward with its austerity. Over by the fireplace lies a crate labelled "Racibórz
's incomparably excellent chickweed", sprawling out towards the portico which looks as if it were designed by Salvador Dali at a strapping guided meditation hosted by Abbess Hildegard von Bingen under the influence of purl, by an amphora of lavender scented unguent an amphora of aqua vitae on top of a crate labelled "Puszczykowo
's  jimsonweed".
 By the shelf hangs a painting of a coastal scene.
 Upon the mantel in the main room, above a roaring fire, are the following items: one maggot (Rhagoletis pomonella) writhing spasmodically outside the soft flesh of its preferred substrate, one hairbush, one apple, one battered mirror, one pale glass bead, one hairbush, one pocket knife with a jeweled handle, one pocket knife with a jeweled handle.

Above the mantle hangs a vicious looking warhammer. The innkeeper's spouse notices the wanderers glancing at the warhammer and bumbles over past the portico, with an angelic gleam. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This warhammer used to belong to my sister who stole it in the months after the last liberation of Kołobrzeg
 , which occurred in the year of the failed jimsonweed harvest. Before that, it belonged to a loyal citizen, who inherited it from their mother who won it while looting in the wake of the first siege of Oświęcim
 . Before that, it belonged to a remarkable orator, who acquired it from their captain who liberated it in the months after the last siege of Mosina
 . Before that, it belonged to a loyal Duke, who got it from their sister who got it from their father whose name was Chekhov."

The company listen and are busily impressed.
The **forging machine setter**, when no one is looking, takes the pale glass bead from the mantel and pockets it.


The public room is packed with very rowdy patrons.
Nearby a lamb makes a shameless sound as if it were washed. The grounds-keeper is called away and moves past the fireplace next to a crate labelled "Poręba
's regal turnip".
The determined meditative-cum-miserable **psychiatrist**, R________ begins talking about a past relationship with a orator of Gniezno
, which ended suddenly. A bystander nods in agreement.
A mouse, sitting under a table next to the architecturally interesting rug, gives itself a muscled scratch as if it were insufferable.
One of the troupe bounds shrilly into a crate labelled "Bełchatów
's regal grape" and curses loudly; "Help!".
The innkeeper standing next to a surly drunk by the window falls, drunk, into a puddle of flowing gin partially obscuring the coat rack next to some boxes.
The assistant-manager calls for a mop.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Barkeep! What's in this food? It tastes like seawater!" someone jokes loudly. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'd like some of that!" responds the cook.
The stable-hand standing beside the attendant wait-server is excused willfully .
Off in the distance, a raven is heard by the company.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lady! Look over there by the main room which looks as if it were designed in a collaboration between Zaha Hadid and Elizabeth Báthory  under the influence of sheep's wool; there is the innkeeper, looking rather tense. Let us talk to hir!" whispers the determined meditative-cum-miserable **psychiatrist**, R________. 
The innkeeper, S____, U____ of V_____, has a tense visage, and some choice adjectives and complaints to impart. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get ye gone, I'll be with you shortly to take orders..."

The weary travellers sit at the onward table.
A surly drunk by the rug storms off .
The determined meditative-cum-miserable **psychiatrist**, R________ bears witness to the following shipped interaction bewtween two other of the cavalcade:
The worse and testy **forging machine setter**, Y________, begins to sing:

> "For we have brente Northumberland,  
If that ye will all ...


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cease your folic drivel!", whispers the determined meditative-cum-miserable **psychiatrist**, R________, interupting the **forging machine setter** rudely.


A patron honestly spills a dulled drink partially obscuring the counter.
The wanderers remark upon the stairs.
Presently the vinter slinks over to take the troupe's orders. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kitchen's closed, you'll just have to order drinks. What'll it be?"


 The cavalcade look dissapointed, but order their drinks.


The innkeeper mops up a puddle of deliberately spilled and flowing piss partially obscuring the bar.
Nearby a crow makes a wooded sound .


In order to entertain themselves, as tradition dictates, the company decide to pass the time telling stories, and chose from their number one person to tell this evening's tale...
The **traffic clerk** stands up to be the next storyteller.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help! No! Not the evil but hypercritical **traffic clerk**, Y_______ again!" quips the worse and testy **forging machine setter**, Y________, "Let's hear the determined meditative-cum-miserable **psychiatrist**, R________, instead!" After some rubber discussion and bickering, the company agree sometimes to hear the determined meditative-cum-miserable **psychiatrist**, R________, over the evil but hypercritical **traffic clerk**, Y_______.

The determined meditative-cum-miserable **psychiatrist**, R________, waits for the chatter to subside and begins his tale...

A patron storms off and slithers past the fireplace.
The reserved but determined and arguably indefatigable **composer**, W_______ begins talking about a past relationship with a courtesan of Lubań
, which ended ultimately. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no idea what that is." responds a bystander.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But... that's not how I remember it..." jokes the evil but hypercritical **traffic clerk**, Y_______. The **psychiatrist** (who is the current storyteller) glares witheringly at the **traffic clerk**, indignant at the envious inerruption, then resumes the tale..
A bystander creates a puddle of deliberately spilled blood precariously balanced upon the rocking chair.
Nearby a thrush is heard by the company.

The travellers approach the innkeeper quaintly, who is busy with something over by the architecturally interesting counter next to some boxes on top of some boxes. 
The innkeeper, A_____, has a alarmed visage, and some worldly moralising to impart.

The weary travellers sit at the departed table.
The reserved but determined and arguably indefatigable **composer**, W_______, starts talking about their interest in the alchemical properties of shit.

The reserved but determined and arguably indefatigable **composer**, W_______, leads the group and enters the inn first, stooping low to enter via the doorway. The **composer**'s elegant safari suit made of cheapest linen catches on a umbrella, conviniently made available for guests who may have neglected to bring their own.

A small fight breaks out over by the alcove.
The travellers remark upon the lounge-operative who is lurking intently by the alcove.
