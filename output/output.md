My boote when thou shold bee."

 Upon the mantel in the main room, above a roaring fire, are the following items: one golden sovereign, one small bust of the poet Cinna (the poet who was murdered at the funeral of Julius Caesar after being mistaken for an unrelated Lucius Cornelius Cinna, who gave a famous speech in support of the assasination of Julius Ceasar), one apple, one maggot (Rhagoletis pomonella) writhing spasmodically outside the soft flesh of its preferred substrate.

Above the mantle hangs a vicious looking flail. The innkeeper notices the group glancing at the flail and moves over past the fireplace, with a seated gleam. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This flail used to belong to my grandfather whose name is unfortunately long forgotten."

The troupe listen and are woefully impressed.
The **insurance underwriter**, when no one is looking, takes the maggot (Rhagoletis pomonella) writhing spasmodically outside the soft flesh of its preferred substrate from the mantel and pockets it.


The public room is not very packed.
A bystander narrowly avoids stepping in a puddle of  fermenting fruit pulp on top of the counter.
The pot-scrubber enters arrogantly from outside bearing a a jar and places it on top of some boxes, next to the shelf.
A surly drunk is excused playfully and dances past the fireplace.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But... that's not how I remember it..." whispers the frantic but respected **shampooer**, Y_______. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ye!" laughs the unknown yet alarmed yet numb **mediator**, M____, "Let the **travel clerk** finish the tale!". The frantic but respected **shampooer**, Y_______ begins talking about a past relationship with a scholar of Kołobrzeg
, which ended smoothly. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no idea what that is." responds one of the cavalcade.
Nearby a cat is heard by the group.
Nearby a fly makes a testimonial sound .

The troupe approach the innkeeper fortunately, who is busy with something over by the shelf. 
The innkeeper, F______ of J____, has a ridiculous bearing, and some choice adjectives and complaints to impart. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be seated, I'll be with you shortly to take orders..."

The weary travellers sit at the intersecting table.
The blah nonetheless dreary **training and development specialist**, D________, starts talking about their interest in porcupines. .
In full view of the stimulated and arguably illogical **precious stone worker**, L_____, who does not understand as a result, the following event takes place:
The irritated and arguably positive **fire investigator**, A________, gives a hair pin to the ugly yet lively **mortician**, Y_______.


The satiated-cum-faithful but not so outspoken **real estate broker**, E____ witnesses a purgatory interaction, and is amused.
The ignored but not so revered **pesticide handler**, A____, and the caring-cum-callous-cum-unsophisticated **insurance underwriter**, H____, set down to the business of trading. The **pesticide handler** swaps a pocket knife with a wooden handle for the **insurance underwriter**'s maggot (Rhagoletis pomonella) writhing spasmodically outside the soft flesh of its preferred substrate.


The alive-cum-frantic nonetheless unemotional **steamfitter**, F________, insults the alluring and defensive nonetheless unmotivated **electrician**, T____'s moth-eaten overcoat.
The ugly yet lively **mortician**, Y_______, is a witness to this in barely contained roomful rage.

The infuriated but not so responsible **ordnance handling expert**, G________, and the cowardly-cum-accomplished but vigilant **travel clerk**, H________, set down to the business of trading. The **ordnance handling expert** swaps a pocket knife with a battered handle for the **travel clerk**'s small coin.


The blah nonetheless dreary **training and development specialist**, D________ witnesses an overboard interaction, and does not understand.
The surly nonetheless glutinous **nonfarm animal caretaker**, H______, begins to sing:

> Beheld baith dale and down,  
Ranne downe her comely face.  
THE SECOND FYTTE  
In green wood you to play;  
The third had causeless banishment,  
A sword and a dagger he wore by his side,  
He set his horn unto his mouth,  
She went alive out of her bower,  
But Robin pulled forth an Irysh knife,  
When the lift grew dark, and the wind blew loud  
"O if he had been twice as fair,  
And kelpie's blast was blawin',

The grumpy but not so invigorated and arguably modest **set designer**, Q______ listens fully, enraputured by the **nonfarm animal caretaker**'s midair voice.


The disposable but not so delightful **advertising sales agent**, Y______ witnesses a smouldering interaction, and dies a little inside.
The unknown yet alarmed yet numb **mediator**, M____, compliments the tormented and imperfect yet stern **astronomer**, L______'s black livery. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your black livery is so much more modernized than my meager stained livery!" laughs the **mediator**.






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not how it happened at all!" interrupts the aggravated fearful and arguably sneering **law enforcement teacher**, G________. The **travel clerk** (who is the current storyteller) glares witheringly at the **law enforcement teacher**, indignant at the outlaw inerruption, then resumes the tale..
The stimulated and arguably illogical **precious stone worker**, L_____ begins talking about a past relationship with a Duchess of Świętochłowice
, which ended loftily. A bystander looks dissaproving.
Presently the attendant wait-server undulates over to take the company's orders. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is our menu, you won't find better fare within three feet of these walls!".

 Presently the party place their orders. the innkeeper storms off and traipses past the main room. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aleyn! We are trying to order food!" laughs the unknown yet alarmed yet numb **mediator**, M____, neatly.
One of the wanderers undulates rigidly into some boxes and curses loudly; "Iame!".
A small fight breaks out over by the door.


In order to entertain themselves, as tradition dictates, the company decide to pass the time telling stories, and nominate from their number one individual to tell this evening's tale.
The **training and development specialist** stands up to be the next storyteller.

The blah nonetheless dreary **training and development specialist**, D________, waits for the chatter to subside and begins his tale...

 ## 13: The **Training And Development Specialist**'s Fifth Tale (5)

Twelve weary travellers make their way by foot towards *The H_____ U_____* Inn.
The weather is very sunny.

In first position travels the irritated and arguably positive **fire investigator**. Then, immediately, the aggravated fearful and arguably sneering **law enforcement teacher**, who nervously clutches a comb. Soon after after is the blah nonetheless dreary **training and development specialist**, who chews honestly on a red glass bead. Then proceeds the caring-cum-callous-cum-unsophisticated **insurance underwriter**, who is wearing a aquamarine frock-coat. Then, conscientiously, the stimulated and arguably illogical **precious stone worker**, soon after followed by the young yet old-fashioned **parts salesperson**, followed by the surly nonetheless glutinous **nonfarm animal caretaker**, who is wearing a elegant livery. Next, the infuriated but not so responsible **ordnance handling expert**, who is wearing a flowing robe. Next, soon after, the frantic but respected **shampooer**. Next in this imitated their this amorphous this posed procession perambulates, stoically, immediately, the capable but worse and arguably exacting **judge**, who nervously clutches a pocket knife with a jeweled handle. Then moves, soon after, the wounded jaded but not so wonderful **chemical plant operator**, who joyously fidgets with a small metal disc.


The aggravated fearful and arguably sneering **law enforcement teacher**, G________ bears witness to the following salient interaction bewtween two other of the cavalcade:
The blah nonetheless dreary **training and development specialist**, D________, compliments the capable but worse and arguably exacting **judge**, M____'s tattered suit. 


The wounded jaded but not so wonderful **chemical plant operator**, H______, compliments the frantic but respected **shampooer**, Y_______'s elegant overcoat made of regal fabric. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your elegant overcoat made of regal fabric is so much more strengthened than my meager pale safari suit!" whispers the **chemical plant operator**.


The caring-cum-callous-cum-unsophisticated **insurance underwriter**, H____, observes and is amused.



As they near their destination they notice  the Inn's sign depicts a very offensive u_____, which appears exceedingly h_____. Stylistically, the sign looks as if it were designed by Julia Child  under the influence of lavender scented unguent. The sign glints in the sun.
The group feels offended as they approach the entrance to the inn.

The wounded jaded but not so wonderful **chemical plant operator**, H______, leads the travellers and enters the inn first, impatiently beckoning the wanderers to follow through the glass paned door. The **chemical plant operator** stops briefly to admire their pale safari suit in a mirror placed in the entranceway.



The interior of The H_____ U_____ suggests dankness. Over by the corner lies an amphora of shit and mercury and ale mixed with a tiny amount of rose-water.
 By the coat rack hangs a painting of a pastoral scene.
 Upon the mantel in the main room, above a roaring fire, are the following items: one comb.

Above the mantle hangs a vicious looking flail. The innkeeper notices the troupe glancing at the flail and shoots over past the coat rack, with an unassuming gleam. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This flail used to belong to my confessor who committed serious crimes for it in the preparations for the first destruction of Zakopane
 , which occurred in the year of the western drought. Before that, it belonged to an enemy courtesan, who acquired it from their cousin who uncovered it in the months after the last destruction of Tarnobrzeg
 , which occurred in the year of the plague of crows. Before that, it belonged to a remarkable warrior, who got it from their priest's lover's grandfather who got it from their mother who got it from their mother who was awarded it in the preparations for the joyous destruction of Szamotuły
 . Before that, it belonged to a wealthy merchant, who got it from their grandfather who performed services in payment for it during the disasterous campaign of Kostrzyn
 . Before that, it belonged to an esteemed cleric, who inherited it from their aunt whose name was Chekhov."

The party listen and are seemingly impressed.
The **ordnance handling expert**, when no one is looking, takes the comb from the mantel and pockets it.


The public room is moderately crowded.
The pot-scrubber is called away .
The pastry-cook enters far from outside bearing a a crate labelled "Kołobrzeg
's cheapest lint" and places it next to a crate labelled "Stryków
's unparalleled pastry crumbs", next to the stairs.
The assistant-manager wriggles usefully into an amphora of formic acid and curses loudly; "Straw!".
A bystander standing partially obscuring a surly drunk saunters noisily into a jar and curses loudly; "How!".


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But... that's not how I remember it..." snarls the irritated and arguably positive **fire investigator**, A________. The **training and development specialist** (who is the current storyteller) glares witheringly at the **fire investigator**, indignant at the vegetative inerruption, then resumes the tale..
The vinter calls for their mother.
Seemingly emanating from an upstairs room, a lac beetle is heard by the cavalcade.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Iame! Look over there by the storeroom; there is the innkeeper, looking rather irritated. Let us talk to him!" snarls the frantic but respected **shampooer**, Y_______. 
The innkeeper, J____ of G____, has a irritated manner, and some worldly advice to impart. Then suddenly, without a word, the innkeeper impatiently waves the troupe to a table, situated near the architecturally interesting bar.

The weary travellers sit at the run-down table.
The innkeeper walks helpfully into some boxes precariously balanced upon an amphora of seawater, precariously balanced upon a jar next to a jar and curses loudly; "Ye!".
The young yet old-fashioned **parts salesperson**, D________, begins to sing:

> God save our king, and bless this land  
I must als  part of your woe  
"Hearken, hearken," sayd the sheriffe,  
For he was a gentle knight.  
AUTHOR  
Of stone and timber strong;  
It were mine ease, to live in peace;  
Did trickle many a teare.  
"To Noroway, to Noroway,  
For here begins no peace.  
"For I fear that you are slain!"  
I dreamt I pu'd the heather green  
Alone, a banished man.  
The Gods shall sure suffice."

The capable but worse and arguably exacting **judge**, M____ listens famously, enraputured by the **parts salesperson**'s professional voice.
The blah nonetheless dreary **training and development specialist**, D________, bears witness in despair.


In full view of the capable but worse and arguably exacting **judge**, M____, who is jealous as a result, the following event takes place:
The infuriated but not so responsible **ordnance handling expert**, G________, talks to the surly nonetheless glutinous **nonfarm animal caretaker**, H______, about the life and exploits of an unknown zealot.The **nonfarm animal caretaker** listens attentively and responds with vigorous enthusiasm.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have had a great curiosity about the life and exploits of an unknown zealot since the days of my youth, when I studied in Żarki
. This is exceptionally enlightening!" effusively exudes the **nonfarm animal caretaker**.





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not how it happened at all!" interrupts the infuriated but not so responsible **ordnance handling expert**, G________. The **training and development specialist** (who is the current storyteller) glares witheringly at the **ordnance handling expert**, indignant at the gratuitous inerruption, then resumes the tale..


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Barkeep! What's in this food? It tastes like mercury!" someone quips loudly. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'd rather consume partisan stew than think about that nonsense!" quips a patron.
Presently the inkeeper slithers over to take the company's orders. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We're all out of food, sorry, you'll just have to order drinks. What'll it be?"


 The wanderers look dissapointed, but order their drinks.


A crow, sitting under a table next to the coat rack, gives itself an outlaw scratch as if it were lobster.
A patron fondly spills a leathern drink sprawling out towards the shelf, by a crate labelled "Mosina
's astounding jimson-weed", on top of some boxes precariously balanced upon an amphora of rose-water precariously balanced upon an amphora of slops the stairs.


In order to entertain themselves, because the night is young, the cavalcade decide to pass the time telling stories, and pick from their number one individual to tell this evening's tale.
The **judge** stands up to be the next storyteller.

The surly nonetheless glutinous **nonfarm animal caretaker**, H______, begins to sing:

> I love but you alone.  
And ere they paid the lawing,  
His lady's ta'en another mate,  
To let sweet William in.  
The king's daughter of Noroway,  
He then bethought him of his bugle-horn,

And you to save; as women have

The travellers listen and are valiantly impressed.
The **law enforcement teacher** wanders over to take a look, and adds a comb to the collection of trinkets.


The public room is not very packed.
The infuriated but not so responsible **ordnance handling expert**, G________, starts talking about their interest in the life and exploits of an unknown zealot. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'd rather consume besieged ichor than high-yield aqua vitae!" laughs a patron.
A patron storms off and sprints unbearably away past the coat rack towards the fireplace.
The pastry-cook storms off and undulates past the door.
One of the travellers standing partially obscuring the innkeeper storms off and bumbles interestingly away past the alcove towards the landing.
One of the troupe by the corner is excused well .
A surly drunk is excused loyally and catapults offensively away past the architecturally interesting counter towards the balustrade. A patron likely spills a groaning drink precariously balanced upon the fireplace.
The stable-hand calls for more wine.
Off in the distance, a dormouse is heard by the party.

The party approach the innkeeper knavishly, who is busy with something over by the portico. 
The innkeeper, O______ of B_______, has a valid bearing, and some and and outsized renewable moralising to impart. Then suddenly, without a word, the innkeeper impatiently waves the group to a table, situated near the bar.

The weary travellers sit at the pillaged table.
The grounds-keeper enters upliftingly from outside bearing a a jar and places it sprawling out towards the storeroom, by an amphora of slops, beside a crate labelled "Pułtusk
's unparalleled grape" a jar, partially obscuring some boxes, beside an amphora of purl, next to the main room.
The aggravated fearful and arguably sneering **law enforcement teacher**, G________, begins to sing:

> A step but barely ane,  
SHE  
So took she all away,  
The...


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cease your illustrative caterwauling!", laughs the capable but worse and arguably exacting **judge**, M____, interupting the **law enforcement teacher** rudely.
The infuriated but not so responsible **ordnance handling expert**, G________, eavesdrops in disgust.


The aggravated fearful and arguably sneering **law enforcement teacher**, G________ bears witness to the following recycled interaction bewtween two other of the party:
The infuriated but not so responsible **ordnance handling expert**, G________, begins to sing:

> And let sharp arrows flee;  
Though I was forc'd theretoe,  
"For His love that sits in throne.  
"But again, dear love, and again, dear love," etc.  
Great heavinesse there hee hadd,  
"But now I have slaine the master," he sayes,  
"I never hurt fair maid in all my time,  
He knocked all at the ring,  
Was like an angell sette.  
"I dreamt a dream last night," she says,  
But Robin he shott far better than hee,

The irritated and arguably positive **fire investigator**, A________ listens frantically, enraputured by the **ordnance handling expert**'s indomitable voice.


Off in the distance, a raven makes an all-round sound as if it were chipotle.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Barkeep! What's in this food? It tastes like juice!" someone jokes loudly. .
Presently the inkeeper slinks over to take the party's orders. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is our menu, you won't find better fare within three score and six spans of these walls!".

 Presently the company place their orders. The company order their meals indivdually, it takes a long time.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But... that's not how I remember it..." snarls the irritated and arguably positive **fire investigator**, A________. The **training and development specialist** (who is the current storyteller) glares witheringly at the **fire investigator**, indignant at the fretted inerruption, then resumes the tale..


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not how it happened at all!" interrupts the frantic but respected **shampooer**, Y_______. The **training and development specialist** (who is the current storyteller) glares witheringly at the **shampooer**, indignant at the bungling inerruption, then resumes the tale..


In order to entertain themselves, since no other alternatives are on offer, the cavalcade decide to pass the time telling stories, and select from their number one individual to tell this evening's tale.
The **judge** stands up to be the next storyteller.

The capable but worse and arguably exacting **judge**, M____, waits for the chatter to subside and begins his tale...

 ## 17: The **Judge**'s Sixth Tale (6)

Eight browbeaten travellers make their way by barge towards *The Y______ G_____* Inn.
The weather is very windy.

Leading,  travels the surly nonetheless glutinous **nonfarm animal caretaker**, who is wearing a elegant livery. Next in this impulsive line perambulates the infuriated but not so responsible **ordnance handling expert**, who is wearing a flowing robe. Then goes the capable but worse and arguably exacting **judge**. Next in line proceeds the frantic but respected **shampooer**, followed by the wounded jaded but not so wonderful **chemical plant operator**. Hopefully after proceeds, stoically, the aggravated fearful and arguably sneering **law enforcement teacher**, who is wearing a odure-stained bathing cosutme made of unparalleled linen. Then comes the blah nonetheless dreary **training and development specialist**, who warmly tosses in the air a purple glass bead.


The surly nonetheless glutinous **nonfarm animal caretaker**, H______, insults the frantic but respected **shampooer**, Y_______'s elegant overcoat made of regal fabric.
The infuriated but not so responsible **ordnance handling expert**, G________, witnesses in confusion.



As they near their destination they notice  the Inn's sign depicts a very transformed g_____, which appears exceedingly y______. Stylistically, the sign looks as if it were designed in a collaboration between Tracy Emin and Salvador Dali at a short revolutionary action hosted by Abbess Hildegard von Bingen while high on snuff and sheep's wool and laudanum and ash and seawater and jimson-weed and seawater and rose-water and ichor and jimson-weed and tobacco. The sign dances crazily in the wind.
The group feels considerate as they approach the entrance to the inn.

The surly nonetheless glutinous **nonfarm animal caretaker**, H______, leads the troupe and enters the inn first, striding gallantly through the rough hewn door. The party notice migrating marks upon the walls.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'd rather consume chipotle rose-water than think about that nonsense!" laughs a bystander


The interior of The Y______ G_____ repells them with its coziness. Over by the portico lies a crate labelled "Zakroczym
's finest jimson-weed", partially obscuring an amphora of purl.
 By the main room hangs a painting of a pastoral scene.
 Upon the mantel in the main room, above a roaring fire, are the following items: one comb.

Above the mantle hangs a vicious looking flail. The innkeeper's cousin notices the group glancing at the flail and sashays over past the main room, with a fractional gleam. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This flail used to belong to my lover's bondsman who is commonly known, in eastern parts at least, as Chekhov."

The party listen and are terribly impressed.
The **ordnance handling expert** wanders over to take a look, and adds a comb to the collection of trinkets.


The public room is moderately crowded.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Barkeep! What's in this food? It tastes like seawater!" someone jokes loudly. A bystander nods in agreement.
The innkeeper falls, drunk, into a puddle of acidentally spilled honey partially obscuring the rocking chair.

Then back again to Gonorel  
And when he came bold Robin before,  
But I will vengeance take,

The capable but worse and arguably exacting **judge**, M____ listens meaningfully, enraputured by the **training and development specialist**'s illustrated voice.
The blah nonetheless dreary **training and development specialist**, D________, bears witness in sympathy.


The capable but worse and arguably exacting **judge**, M____, starts talking about their interest in porcupines. .
The attendant wait-server calls for a shoulder to cry on.
Presently the pastry-cook charges over to take the cavalcade's orders. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, what do you lot want?".

 The travellers order food. one of the cavalcade by the storeroom stumbles sheepishly into a crate labelled "Międzyrzec Podlaski
's cheapest lint" and curses loudly; "Abyde!". 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fy! We are trying to order food!" whispers the capable but worse and arguably exacting **judge**, M____, fast.
The cook draws attention to a puddle of stagnant seawater sprawling out towards the door, by a jar precariously balanced upon an amphora of rainwater the bar.
A patron by the portico standing precariously balanced upon the innkeeper standing sprawling out towards the landing, by an amphora of rubbing alcohol the pot-scrubber leaps tomorrow into some boxes, beside a crate labelled "Kórnik
's regal potato" and curses loudly; "Ye!".


In order to entertain themselves, because the night is young, the cavalcade decide to pass the time telling stories, and choose from their number one individual to tell this evening's tale.
The **judge** stands up to be the next storyteller.

The capable but worse and arguably exacting **judge**, M____, waits for the chatter to subside and begins his tale...

 ## 23: The **Judge**'s Eighth Tale (8)

A pair of lusty travellers make their way by sea towards *The U_______'s C______* Inn.
The weather is sunny.

In first position comes the capable but worse and arguably exacting **judge**.



As they near their destination they notice  the Inn's sign depicts a very metallic c______, belonging to a metabolic u_______. Stylistically, the sign looks as if it were designed by Elizabeth Báthory at a woeful party hosted by Hieronymus Bosch while high on aqua vitae and vomit. The sign glints in the sun.
The group feels competitive as they approach the entrance to the inn.

The capable but worse and arguably exacting **judge**, M____, leads the troupe and enters the inn first, stooping low to enter via the doorway. The travellers notice whirlwind marks upon the walls.
A bystander guffaws hysterically


The interior of The U_______'s C______ is the embodiment of chasteness. Over by the coat rack lies an amphora of rose-water.
 By the balustrade hangs a painting of a pastoral scene.
 Upon the mantel in the main room, above a roaring fire, are the following items: one pocket knife with a jeweled handle.

Above the mantle hangs a vicious looking flail. Next to it is a small bronze plate. It reads: "Chekhov's flail which Chekhov performed services in payment for in the months after the bungled liberation of Grodzisk Wielkopolski
 , which occurred in the year of the failed jimsonweed harvest".
The **judge**, when no one is looking, takes the pocket knife with a jeweled handle from the mantel and pockets it.


The public room has a reasonable crowd.
Nearby a rat makes a convertible sound as if it were mixed.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Out! We are but a pair of weary travellers in need of lodging and good cheer!" snarls the capable but worse and arguably exacting **judge**, M____. 
The innkeeper, B_____ of A____, has a whimsical visage, and some eradicated claptrap complaints to impart. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grab yourselves a table, I'll be with you shortly to take orders..."

The weary travellers sit at the human table.
Presently the inkeeper traipses over to take the party's orders. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is our menu, you won't find better fare within much more than five score feet of these walls!".

 Presently the wanderers place their orders. The party remark upon their surroundings. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Parde! We are trying to order food!" whispers the capable but worse and arguably exacting **judge**, M____, smoothly.


In order to entertain themselves, as is their custom on this journey, the group decide to pass the time telling stories, and choose from their number one individual to tell this evening's tale.

You listen in silence to the **judge**'s tale. You can't help eyeing the flail above the mantel, dark thoughts running through your mind.

Tomorrow there will be one less traveller on the journey ahead.

**ÞE END**
