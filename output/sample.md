Fourteen optimistic travellers make their way by ocean going vessel towards *The P____ M________* Inn.
It is barely fair.
At the forefront of the party passes the loose and possessive and lovable traffic technician, immediately followed by the justified but not so yearning crafty carpenter. Then travels the confused and arguably pretty recreational vehicle service technician. Next, immediately, the fanciful productive yet interesting barback. Next, the shunned but cordial insurance underwriter. Next, the restless but gullible-cum-love-lorn actuary. Next, the wild yet interesting purchasing agent, soon after followed by the wasted yet keen computer support specialist. Then the flirty and dead but interesting engineering teacher. Next, the affectionate stressed nonetheless hearty foundry coremaker, followed by the responsible but not so indifferent and arguably uncooperative oral surgeon. Then goes, stoically, the terrifying worthy and unmotivated heavy truck driver. Then the fulfilled but not so restricted nonetheless warm exhibit designer. Next, the guilty and silly yet efficient boilermaker.
