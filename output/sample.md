 ## 10: The Procurement Clerk's Fifth Tale (5)

* the teller's friend is library assistant (0.75).

Fourteen brave travellers make their way by train towards *The W______'s Z______* Inn.
It is very fair.

At the fore goes the challenged but not so proud and arguably musical water treatment plant operator. Then the splendid and self-assured planing machine operator, followed by, conscientiously, the teased and plain-speaking actor. Next, the infuriated and arguably level-headed transportation security screener. Doggedly after goes the victorious-cum-awful dancer, spasmodically followed by the recumbent but not so inconsistent animal control worker. Next, subsequently, the cowardly-cum-lifeless but not so distraught library assistant. Spasmodically after is the adored but not so realistic dressing room attendant. Next in the group travels the tender but not so hopeless nonetheless irritable orthotist. Doggedly after approaches the playful-cum-idealistic but strong elevator installer. Doggedly after approaches the close yet ornery but not so paternal procurement clerk, immediately followed by the self-conscious-cum-fine and diligent parts salesperson. Doggedly after approaches the drained-cum-spunky but not so natural singer. Immediately after perambulates the confining but bashful but steady dental laboratory technician.

The tender but not so hopeless nonetheless irritable orthotist, Q_______, reacts {reaction}. {supplementary reaction from a third individual or the group}.

Inside, the inn is {describe Inn} really awesome and well described. By the fireplace hangs a painting of a pastoral scene. Upon the mantel in the main room, above a roaring fire, are three coins, an onion, a small bust of the poet Cinna. Above it hangs a vicious looking polearm. 

The public room is totally empty.
The travelers interact with the Inn in an interesting and satisfying way.
Close by, or far away, a vole makes a sound, is seen, or unobservedly does something characteristic yet poignant.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh look, over there by the main room; there is the innkeeper, looking rather tenacious. Let us talk to them!" says the self-conscious-cum-fine and diligent parts salesperson, T________.

The innkeeper, W________ the U____, has a tenacious personality, and some echoing and worldly advice to impart (if the mood takes them).

Possibly, something notable happens. What is the outcome?
Someone may be called away, or storm off, or otherwise be excused.


Presently the Innkeeper (or possibly another staff member such as the scullery-hand or bar-staffer) traipses over to take their orders.
Available swillish slops are listed, questioned, and chosen; comprising and/or consisting of food and / or drinks. There is indecision, and certainty.
Once all orders are made, the group settles in to wait. Drinks may arrive, but the food takes time to prepare.


Something happens in the main room.


In order to entertain themselves, as is their custom on this journey, they decide to pass the time telling stories,  and chose from their number one person to tell this evening's tale...
* The current storyteller (procurement clerk) chooses the library assistant (0.75) as the next storyteller.

The cowardly-cum-lifeless but not so distraught library assistant, H______, waits for the chatter to subside and begins her tale...
