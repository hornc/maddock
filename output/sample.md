 Upon the mantel in the main room, above a roaring fire, are the following items: one one golden sovereign, one fillament of black wool, one jeweled mirror, one tin fob, one small bust of the poet Cinna, one scrap of pale cloth, one pocket knife with a battered handle, one snuff-box, one small coin.
